# Example of Neovim configuration for writing with LaTeX with LazyVim

This configuration is shown in a few blog posts at <https://www.lorenzobettini.it>:

* The first part, which ends in the branch **first-blog-post**, is described in the blog post <https://www.lorenzobettini.it/2024/11/neovim-and-java-with-lazyvim-part-1-initial-configuration>.
* The second part, which ends in the branch **second-blog-post**, is described in the blog post <https://www.lorenzobettini.it/2026/01/neovim-and-latex-with-lazyvim-part-2-customizations/>

To test it without overriding your Neovim configuration:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:LorenzoBettini/lazyvim-tex.git ~/.config/lazyvim-tex
```

And then, to use it:

```shell
NVIM_APPNAME=lazyvim-tex nvim
```
